# IA-3 Device Identification and Authentication {#ia-03}

_Implementation Level_: system### Control

Uniquely identify and authenticate [Assignment: devices and/or types of devices] before establishing a [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection.

## IA-3(1) Cryptographic Bidirectional Authentication {#ia-03.01}

### Control

Authenticate [Assignment: devices and/or types of devices] before establishing [Selection (one or more): local; remote; network] connection using bidirectional authentication that is cryptographically based.

## IA-3(2) Cryptographic Bidirectional Network Authentication {#ia-03.02}

## IA-3(3) Dynamic Address Allocation {#ia-03.03}

### Control

(a) Where addresses are allocated dynamically, standardize dynamic address allocation lease information and the lease duration assigned to devices in accordance with [Assignment: organization-defined lease information and lease duration] ; and

(b) Audit lease information when assigned to a device.

## IA-3(4) Device Attestation {#ia-03.04}
