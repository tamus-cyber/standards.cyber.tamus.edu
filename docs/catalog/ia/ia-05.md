# IA-5 Authenticator Management {#ia-05}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Implementation Level_: system_Texas DIR Baseline_: LOW_Texas DIR Required By_: 2023-07-20### Control

a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator;

b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization;

c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;

d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;

e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;

f. Changing or refreshing authenticators [Assignment: time period by authenticator type] or when [Assignment: events] occur;

g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;

h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific controls to protect authenticators; and

i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.

## IA-5(1) Password-based Authentication {#ia-05.01}

### Control

(a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list [Assignment: frequency] and when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or indirectly;

(b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5(1)(a);

(c) Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels;

(d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably using a keyed hash;

(e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;

(f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable characters;

(g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password authenticators; and

(h) Enforce the following composition and complexity rules: [Assignment: composition and complexity rules].

## IA-5(2) Public Key-based Authentication {#ia-05.02}

### Control

(a) For public key-based authentication:

(1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and

(2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and

(b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:

(1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status information; and

(2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation.

## IA-5(3) In-person or Trusted External Party Registration {#ia-05.03}

## IA-5(4) Automated Support for Password Strength Determination {#ia-05.04}

## IA-5(5) Change Authenticators Prior to Delivery {#ia-05.05}

### Control

Require developers and installers of system components to provide unique authenticators or change default authenticators prior to delivery and installation.

## IA-5(6) Protection of Authenticators {#ia-05.06}

### Control

Protect authenticators commensurate with the security category of the information to which use of the authenticator permits access.

## IA-5(7) No Embedded Unencrypted Static Authenticators {#ia-05.07}

### Control

Ensure that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.

## IA-5(8) Multiple System Accounts {#ia-05.08}

### Control

Implement [Assignment: security controls] to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.

## IA-5(9) Federated Credential Management {#ia-05.09}

### Control

Use the following external organizations to federate credentials: [Assignment: external organizations].

## IA-5(10) Dynamic Credential Binding {#ia-05.10}

### Control

Bind identities and authenticators dynamically using the following rules: [Assignment: binding rules].

## IA-5(11) Hardware Token-based Authentication {#ia-05.11}

## IA-5(12) Biometric Authentication Performance {#ia-05.12}

### Control

For biometric-based authentication, employ mechanisms that satisfy the following biometric quality requirements [Assignment: biometric quality requirements].

## IA-5(13) Expiration of Cached Authenticators {#ia-05.13}

### Control

Prohibit the use of cached authenticators after [Assignment: time period].

## IA-5(14) Managing Content of PKI Trust Stores {#ia-05.14}

### Control

For PKI-based authentication, employ an organization-wide methodology for managing the content of PKI trust stores installed across all platforms, including networks, operating systems, browsers, and applications.

## IA-5(15) GSA-approved Products and Services {#ia-05.15}

### Control

Use only General Services Administration-approved products and services for identity, credential, and access management.

## IA-5(16) In-person or Trusted External Party Authenticator Issuance {#ia-05.16}

### Control

Require that the issuance of [Assignment: types of and/or specific authenticators] be conducted [Selection: in person; by a trusted external party] before [Assignment: registration authority] with authorization by [Assignment: personnel or roles].

## IA-5(17) Presentation Attack Detection for Biometric Authenticators {#ia-05.17}

### Control

Employ presentation attack detection mechanisms for biometric-based authentication.

## IA-5(18) Password Managers {#ia-05.18}

### Control

(a) Employ [Assignment: password managers] to generate and manage passwords; and

(b) Protect the passwords using [Assignment: controls].
