# PE-3 Physical Access Control {#pe-03}

a. Enforce physical access authorizations at [Assignment: entry and exit points] by:

1. Verifying individual access authorizations before granting access to the facility; and

2. Controlling ingress and egress to the facility using [Selection (one or more): 
                  [Assignment: systems or devices]
               ; guards];

b. Maintain physical access audit logs for [Assignment: entry or exit points];

c. Control access to areas within the facility designated as publicly accessible by implementing the following controls: [Assignment: physical access controls];

d. Escort visitors and control visitor activity [Assignment: circumstances];

e. Secure keys, combinations, and other physical access devices;

f. Inventory [Assignment: physical access devices] every [Assignment: frequency] ; and

g. Change combinations and keys [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and/or when keys are lost, combinations are compromised, or when individuals possessing the keys or combinations are transferred or terminated.

## PE-3(1) System Access {#pe-03.01}

Enforce physical access authorizations to the system in addition to the physical access controls for the facility at [Assignment: physical spaces].

## PE-3(2) Facility and Systems {#pe-03.02}

Perform security checks [Assignment: frequency] at the physical perimeter of the facility or system for exfiltration of information or removal of system components.

## PE-3(3) Continuous Guards {#pe-03.03}

Employ guards to control [Assignment: physical access points] to the facility where the system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

## PE-3(4) Lockable Casings {#pe-03.04}

Use lockable physical casings to protect [Assignment: system components] from unauthorized physical access.

## PE-3(5) Tamper Protection {#pe-03.05}

Employ [Assignment: anti-tamper technologies] to [Selection (one or more): detect; prevent] physical tampering or alteration of [Assignment: hardware components] within the system.

## PE-3(6) Facility Penetration Testing {#pe-03.06}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [CA-8](../ca/ca-08#ca-08).]

## PE-3(7) Physical Barriers {#pe-03.07}

Limit access using physical barriers.

## PE-3(8) Access Control Vestibules {#pe-03.08}

Employ access control vestibules at [Assignment: locations].
