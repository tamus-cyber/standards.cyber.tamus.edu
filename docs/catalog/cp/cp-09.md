# CP-9 System Backup {#cp-09}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Texas DIR Baseline_: LOW_Texas DIR Required By_: 2023-07-20### Control

a. Conduct backups of user-level information contained in [Assignment: system components]
                  [Assignment: frequency];

b. Conduct backups of system-level information contained in the system [Assignment: frequency];

c. Conduct backups of system documentation, including security- and privacy-related documentation [Assignment: frequency] ; and

d. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information.

## CP-9(1) Testing for Reliability and Integrity {#cp-09.01}

### Control

Test backup information [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to verify media reliability and information integrity.

## CP-9(2) Test Restoration Using Sampling {#cp-09.02}

### Control

Use a sample of backup information in the restoration of selected system functions as part of contingency plan testing.

## CP-9(3) Separate Storage for Critical Information {#cp-09.03}

### Control

Store backup copies of [Assignment: information systems that process and/or store sensitive or high-impact information] in a separate facility or in a fire rated container that is not collocated with the operational system.

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

Protect [Assignment: information systems that process and/or store sensitive or high-impact information] with a backup strategy which uses immutable backup storage and/or an out-of-band backup process that prevents direct access to backup storage from the organization's production networks.

## CP-9(4) Protection from Unauthorized Modification {#cp-09.04}

## CP-9(5) Transfer to Alternate Storage Site {#cp-09.05}

### Control

Transfer system backup information to the alternate storage site [Assignment: organization-defined time period and transfer rate consistent with the recovery time and recovery point objectives].

## CP-9(6) Redundant Secondary System {#cp-09.06}

### Control

Conduct system backup by maintaining a redundant secondary system that is not collocated with the primary system and that can be activated without loss of information or disruption to operations.

## CP-9(7) Dual Authorization for Deletion or Destruction {#cp-09.07}

### Control

Enforce dual authorization for the deletion or destruction of [Assignment: backup information].

## CP-9(8) Cryptographic Protection {#cp-09.08}

### Control

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of [Assignment: backup information].
