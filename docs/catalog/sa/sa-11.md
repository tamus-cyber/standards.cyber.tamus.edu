# SA-11 Developer Testing and Evaluation {#sa-11}

a. Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy control assessments;

b. Perform [Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression] testing/evaluation [Assignment: frequency to conduct] at [Assignment: depth and coverage];

c. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and evaluation;

d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and

e. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.

## SA-11(1) Static Code Analysis {#sa-11.01}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.

## SA-11(2) Threat Modeling and Vulnerability Analyses {#sa-11.02}

(a) Uses the following contextual information: [Assignment: information];

(b) Employs the following tools and methods: [Assignment: tools and methods];

(c) Conducts the modeling and analyses at the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of modeling and analyses] ; and

(d) Produces evidence that meets the following acceptance criteria: [Assignment: organization-defined acceptance criteria].

## SA-11(3) Independent Verification of Assessment Plans and Evidence {#sa-11.03}

(a) Require an independent agent satisfying [Assignment: independence criteria] to verify the correct implementation of the developer security and privacy assessment plans and the evidence produced during testing and evaluation; and

(b) Verify that the independent agent is provided with sufficient information to complete the verification process or granted the authority to obtain such information.

## SA-11(4) Manual Code Reviews {#sa-11.04}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a manual code review of [Assignment: specific code] using the following processes, procedures, and/or techniques: [Assignment: processes, procedures, and/or techniques].

## SA-11(5) Penetration Testing {#sa-11.05}

(a) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of testing] ; and

(b) Under the following constraints: [Assignment: constraints].

## SA-11(6) Attack Surface Reviews {#sa-11.06}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform attack surface reviews.

## SA-11(7) Verify Scope of Testing and Evaluation {#sa-11.07}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to verify that the scope of testing and evaluation provides complete coverage of the required controls at the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of testing and evaluation].

## SA-11(8) Dynamic Code Analysis {#sa-11.08}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ dynamic code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.

## SA-11(9) Interactive Application Security Testing {#sa-11.09}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ interactive application security testing tools to identify flaws and document the results.
