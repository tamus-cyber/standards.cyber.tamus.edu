## SA-4(1) Functional Properties of Controls {#sa-04.01}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide a description of the functional properties of the controls to be implemented.

## SA-4(2) Design and Implementation Information for Controls {#sa-04.02}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide design and implementation information for the controls that includes: [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; 
                     [Assignment: design and implementation information]
                  ] at [Assignment: level of detail].

## SA-4(3) Development Methods, Techniques, and Practices {#sa-04.03}

(a) 
                     [Assignment: systems engineering methods];

(b) 
                     [Selection (one or more): 
                     [Assignment: system security engineering methods]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: privacy engineering methods]
                  ] ; and

(c) 
                     [Selection (one or more): 
                     [Assignment: software development methods]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: testing, evaluation, assessment, verification, and validation methods]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: quality control processes]
                  ].

## SA-4(4) Assignment of Components to Systems {#sa-04.04}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [CM-8(9)](../cm/cm-08#cm-08.09).]

## SA-4(5) System, Component, and Service Configurations {#sa-04.05}

(a) Deliver the system, component, or service with [Assignment: security configurations] implemented; and

(b) Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

## SA-4(6) Use of Information Assurance Products {#sa-04.06}

(a) Employ only government off-the-shelf or commercial off-the-shelf information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products that compose an NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and

(b) Ensure that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or in accordance with NSA-approved procedures.

## SA-4(7) NIAP-approved Protection Profiles  {#sa-04.07}

(a) Limit the use of commercially provided information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; and

(b) Require, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated or NSA-approved.

## SA-4(8) Continuous Monitoring Plan for Controls {#sa-04.08}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a plan for continuous monitoring of control effectiveness that is consistent with the continuous monitoring program of the organization.

## SA-4(9) Functions, Ports, Protocols, and Services in Use {#sa-04.09}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.

## SA-4(10) Use of Approved PIV Products {#sa-04.10}

Employ only information technology products on the FIPS 201-approved products list for Personal Identity Verification (PIV) capability implemented within organizational systems.

## SA-4(11) System of Records {#sa-04.11}

Include [Assignment: Privacy Act requirements] in the acquisition contract for the operation of a system of records on behalf of an organization to accomplish an organizational mission or function.

## SA-4(12) Data Ownership {#sa-04.12}

(a) Include organizational data ownership requirements in the acquisition contract; and

(b) Require all data to be removed from the contractorâ€™s system and returned to the organization within [Assignment: time frame].
