b. Strength of mechanism requirements;

c. Security and privacy assurance requirements;

d. Controls needed to satisfy the security and privacy requirements.

e. Security and privacy documentation requirements;

f. Requirements for protecting security and privacy documentation;

g. Description of the system development environment and environment in which the system is intended to operate;

h. Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management; and

i. Acceptance criteria.

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

Each state agency entering into or renewing a contract with a vendor authorized to access, transmit, use, or store data for the agency shall include a provision in the contract requiring the vendor to meet the security controls the agency determines are proportionate with the agency's risk under the contract based on the sensitivity of the agency's data. The vendor must periodically provide to the agency evidence that the vendor meets the security controls required under the contract.

### Texas A&M System Implementation Statement

a. Reviews and approves the security requirements in acquisition contracts of any new information system that processes and/or stores sensitive or high-impact information prior to the member procuring the system or service, and

b. Ensures acquisition contracts for information systems, system components, or information system services address information security, backup, and privacy requirements.

1. Such contracts should include right-to-audit and other provisions to provide appropriate assurance that applications and information are adequately protected.

2. Vendors and third parties adhere to all state and Federal laws and System policies pertaining to the protection of information resources and privacy of sensitive information.

## SA-4(1) Functional Properties of Controls {#sa-04.01}

## SA-4(2) Design and Implementation Information for Controls {#sa-04.02}

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide design and implementation information for the controls that includes: [Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; 
                     [Assignment: design and implementation information]
                  ] at [Assignment: level of detail].

## SA-4(3) Development Methods, Techniques, and Practices {#sa-04.03}

### Control

(a) 
                     [Assignment: systems engineering methods];

(b) 
                     [Selection (one or more): 
                     [Assignment: system security engineering methods]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: privacy engineering methods]
                  ] ; and

(c) 
                     [Selection (one or more): 
                     [Assignment: software development methods]
                  ;

                  ; 
                     [Assignment: quality control processes]
                  ].

## SA-4(4) Assignment of Components to Systems {#sa-04.04}

## SA-4(5) System, Component, and Service Configurations {#sa-04.05}

### Control

(a) Deliver the system, component, or service with [Assignment: security configurations] implemented; and

(b) Use the configurations as the default for any subsequent system, component, or service reinstallation or upgrade.

## SA-4(6) Use of Information Assurance Products {#sa-04.06}

### Control

(a) Employ only government off-the-shelf or commercial off-the-shelf information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products that compose an NSA-approved solution to protect classified information when the networks used to transmit the information are at a lower classification level than the information being transmitted; and

(b) Ensure that these products have been evaluated and/or validated by NSA or in accordance with NSA-approved procedures.

## SA-4(7) NIAP-approved Protection Profiles  {#sa-04.07}

### Control

(a) Limit the use of commercially provided information assurance and information assurance-enabled information technology products to those products that have been successfully evaluated against a National Information Assurance partnership (NIAP)-approved Protection Profile for a specific technology type, if such a profile exists; and

(b) Require, if no NIAP-approved Protection Profile exists for a specific technology type but a commercially provided information technology product relies on cryptographic functionality to enforce its security policy, that the cryptographic module is FIPS-validated or NSA-approved.

## SA-4(8) Continuous Monitoring Plan for Controls {#sa-04.08}

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a plan for continuous monitoring of control effectiveness that is consistent with the continuous monitoring program of the organization.
