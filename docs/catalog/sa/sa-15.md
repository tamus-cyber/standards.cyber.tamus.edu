# SA-15 Development Process, Standards, and Tools {#sa-15}

a. Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a documented development process that:

1. Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;

2. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;

3. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and

4. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and

b. Review the development process, standards, tools, tool options, and tool configurations [Assignment: frequency] to determine if the process, standards, tools, tool options and tool configurations selected and employed can satisfy the following security and privacy requirements: [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy requirements].

## SA-15(1) Quality Metrics {#sa-15.01}

(a) Define quality metrics at the beginning of the development process; and

(b) Provide evidence of meeting the quality metrics [Selection (one or more): 
                     [Assignment: frequency]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: program review]
                  ; upon delivery].

## SA-15(2) Security and Privacy Tracking Tools {#sa-15.02}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to select and employ security and privacy tracking tools for use during the development process.

## SA-15(3) Criticality Analysis {#sa-15.03}

(a) At the following decision points in the system development life cycle: [Assignment: decision points] ; and

(b) At the following level of rigor: [Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of criticality analysis].

## SA-15(4) Threat Modeling and Vulnerability Analysis {#sa-15.04}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SA-11(2)](../sa/sa-11#sa-11.02).]

## SA-15(5) Attack Surface Reduction {#sa-15.05}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to reduce attack surfaces to [Assignment: thresholds].

## SA-15(6) Continuous Improvement {#sa-15.06}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to implement an explicit process to continuously improve the development process.

## SA-15(7) Automated Vulnerability Analysis {#sa-15.07}

(a) Perform an automated vulnerability analysis using [Assignment: tools];

(b) Determine the exploitation potential for discovered vulnerabilities;

(c) Determine potential risk mitigations for delivered vulnerabilities; and

(d) Deliver the outputs of the tools and results of the analysis to [Assignment: personnel or roles].

## SA-15(8) Reuse of Threat and Vulnerability Information {#sa-15.08}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to use threat modeling and vulnerability analyses from similar systems, components, or services to inform the current development process.

## SA-15(9) Use of Live Data {#sa-15.09}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SA-3(2)](../sa/sa-03#sa-03.02).]

## SA-15(10) Incident Response Plan {#sa-15.10}

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide, implement, and test an incident response plan.

## SA-15(11) Archive System or Component {#sa-15.11}

Require the developer of the system or system component to archive the system or component to be released or delivered together with the corresponding evidence supporting the final security and privacy review.

## SA-15(12) Minimize Personally Identifiable Information {#sa-15.12}

Require the developer of the system or system component to minimize the use of personally identifiable information in development and test environments.
