# SA-17 Developer Security and Privacy Architecture and Design {#sa-17}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Contributes to Assurance_: true### Control

a. Is consistent with the organization’s security and privacy architecture that is an integral part the organization’s enterprise architecture;

b. Accurately and completely describes the required security and privacy functionality, and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components; and

c. Expresses how individual security and privacy functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security and privacy capabilities and a unified approach to protection.

## SA-17(1) Formal Policy Model {#sa-17.01}

### Control

(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal policy model describing the [Assignment: organization-defined elements of organizational security and privacy policy] to be enforced; and

(b) Prove that the formal policy model is internally consistent and sufficient to enforce the defined elements of the organizational security and privacy policy when implemented.

## SA-17(2) Security-relevant Components {#sa-17.02}

### Control

(a) Define security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

(b) Provide a rationale that the definition for security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware is complete.

## SA-17(3) Formal Correspondence {#sa-17.03}

### Control

(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

(b) Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

(c) Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

(d) Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

(e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## SA-17(4) Informal Correspondence {#sa-17.04}

### Control

(a) Produce, as an integral part of the development process, an informal descriptive top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;

(b) Show via [Selection: informal demonstration, convincing argument with formal methods as feasible] that the descriptive top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;

(c) Show via informal demonstration, that the descriptive top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;

(d) Show that the descriptive top-level specification is an accurate description of the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and

(e) Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the descriptive top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.

## SA-17(5) Conceptually Simple Design {#sa-17.05}

### Control

(a) Design and structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to use a complete, conceptually simple protection mechanism with precisely defined semantics; and

(b) Internally structure the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware with specific regard for this mechanism.

## SA-17(6) Structure for Testing {#sa-17.06}

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate testing.

## SA-17(7) Structure for Least Privilege {#sa-17.07}

### Control

Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to structure security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware to facilitate controlling access with least privilege.

## SA-17(8) Orchestration {#sa-17.08}

### Control

Design [Assignment: critical systems] with coordinated behavior to implement the following capabilities: [Assignment: capabilities].

## SA-17(9) Design Diversity {#sa-17.09}

### Control

Use different designs for [Assignment: critical systems] to satisfy a common set of requirements or to provide equivalent functionality.
