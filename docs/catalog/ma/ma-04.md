# MA-4 Nonlocal Maintenance {#ma-04}

a. Approve and monitor nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities;

b. Allow the use of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic tools only as consistent with organizational policy and documented in the security plan for the system;

c. Employ strong authentication in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions;

d. Maintain records for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities; and

e. Terminate session and network connections when nonlocal maintenance is completed.

## MA-4(1) Logging and Review {#ma-04.01}

(a) Log [Assignment: organization-defined audit events] for nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions; and

(b) Review the audit records of the maintenance and diagnostic sessions to detect anomalous behavior.

## MA-4(2) Document Nonlocal Maintenance {#ma-04.02}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [MA-1](../ma/ma-01#ma-01), [MA-4](../ma/ma-04#ma-04).]

## MA-4(3) Comparable Security and Sanitization {#ma-04.03}

(a) Require that nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic services be performed from a system that implements a security capability comparable to the capability implemented on the system being serviced; or

(b) Remove the component to be serviced from the system prior to nonlocal maintenance or diagnostic services; sanitize the component (for organizational information); and after the service is performed, inspect and sanitize the component (for potentially malicious software) before reconnecting the component to the system.

## MA-4(4) Authentication and Separation of Maintenance Sessions {#ma-04.04}

(a) Employing [Assignment: authenticators that are replay resistant] ; and

(b) Separating the maintenance sessions from other network sessions with the system by either:

(1) Physically separated communications paths; or

(2) Logically separated communications paths.

## MA-4(5) Approvals and Notifications {#ma-04.05}

(a) Require the approval of each nonlocal maintenance session by [Assignment: personnel or roles] ; and

(b) Notify the following personnel or roles of the date and time of planned nonlocal maintenance: [Assignment: personnel and roles].

## MA-4(6) Cryptographic Protection {#ma-04.06}

Implement the following cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity and confidentiality of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic communications: [Assignment: cryptographic mechanisms].

## MA-4(7) Disconnect Verification {#ma-04.07}

Verify session and network connection termination after the completion of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions.
