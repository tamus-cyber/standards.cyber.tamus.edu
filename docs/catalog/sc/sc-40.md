# SC-40 Wireless Link Protection {#sc-40}

Protect external and internal [Assignment: organization-defined wireless links] from the following signal parameter attacks: [Assignment: organization-defined types of signal parameter attacks or references to sources for such attacks].

## SC-40(1) Electromagnetic Interference {#sc-40.01}

Implement cryptographic mechanisms that achieve [Assignment: level of protection] against the effects of intentional electromagnetic interference.

## SC-40(2) Reduce Detection Potential {#sc-40.02}

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to reduce the detection potential of wireless links to [Assignment: level of reduction].

## SC-40(3) Imitative or Manipulative Communications Deception {#sc-40.03}

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to identify and reject wireless transmissions that are deliberate attempts to achieve imitative or manipulative communications deception based on signal parameters.

## SC-40(4) Signal Parameter Identification {#sc-40.04}

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent the identification of [Assignment: wireless transmitters] by using the transmitter signal parameters.
