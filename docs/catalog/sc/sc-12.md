# SC-12 Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management {#sc-12}

Establish and manage cryptographic keys when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with the following key management requirements: [Assignment: requirements].

## SC-12(1) Availability {#sc-12.01}

Maintain availability of information in the event of the loss of cryptographic keys by users.

## SC-12(2) Symmetric Keys {#sc-12.02}

Produce, control, and distribute symmetric cryptographic keys using [Selection: NIST FIPS-validated; NSA-approved] key management technology and processes.

## SC-12(3) Asymmetric Keys {#sc-12.03}

Produce, control, and distribute asymmetric cryptographic keys using [Selection: NSA-approved key management technology and processes; prepositioned keying material; DoD-approved or DoD-issued Medium Assurance PKI certificates; DoD-approved or DoD-issued Medium Hardware Assurance PKI certificates and hardware security tokens that protect the userâ€™s private key; certificates issued in accordance with organization-defined requirements].

## SC-12(4) PKI Certificates {#sc-12.04}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SC-12(3)](../sc/sc-12#sc-12.03).]

## SC-12(5) PKI Certificates / Hardware Tokens {#sc-12.05}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SC-12(3)](../sc/sc-12#sc-12.03).]

## SC-12(6) Physical Control of Keys {#sc-12.06}

Maintain physical control of cryptographic keys when stored information is encrypted by external service providers.
