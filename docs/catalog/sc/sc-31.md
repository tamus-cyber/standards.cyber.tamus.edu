title: SC-31 Covert Channel Analysis
description: ""
---

# SC-31 Covert Channel Analysis {#sc-31}

a. Perform a covert channel analysis to identify those aspects of communications within the system that are potential avenues for covert [Selection (one or more): storage; timing] channels; and

b. Estimate the maximum bandwidth of those channels.

## SC-31(1) Test Covert Channels for Exploitability {#sc-31.01}

Test a subset of the identified covert channels to determine the channels that are exploitable.

## SC-31(2) Maximum Bandwidth {#sc-31.02}

Reduce the maximum bandwidth for identified covert [Selection (one or more): storage; timing] channels to [Assignment: values].

## SC-31(3) Measure Bandwidth in Operational Environments {#sc-31.03}

Measure the bandwidth of [Assignment: subset of identified covert channels] in the operational environment of the system.
