# SC-3 Security Function Isolation {#sc-03}

_Implementation Level_: system_Contributes to Assurance_: true### Control

Isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.

## SC-3(1) Hardware Separation {#sc-03.01}

### Control

Employ hardware separation mechanisms to implement security function isolation.

## SC-3(2) Access and Flow Control Functions {#sc-03.02}

### Control

Isolate security functions enforcing access and information flow control from nonsecurity functions and from other security functions.

## SC-3(3) Minimize Nonsecurity Functionality {#sc-03.03}

### Control

Minimize the number of nonsecurity functions included within the isolation boundary containing security functions.

## SC-3(4) Module Coupling and Cohesiveness {#sc-03.04}

### Control

Implement security functions as largely independent modules that maximize internal cohesiveness within modules and minimize coupling between modules.

## SC-3(5) Layered Structures {#sc-03.05}

### Control

Implement security functions as a layered structure minimizing interactions between layers of the design and avoiding any dependence by lower layers on the functionality or correctness of higher layers.
