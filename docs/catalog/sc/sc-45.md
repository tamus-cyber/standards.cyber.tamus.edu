Synchronize system clocks within and between systems and system components.

(a) Compare the internal system clocks [Assignment: frequency] with [Assignment: authoritative time source] ; and

(b) Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than [Assignment: time period].

## SC-45(2) Secondary Authoritative Time Source {#sc-45.02}

(a) Identify a secondary authoritative time source that is in a different geographic region than the primary authoritative time source; and
