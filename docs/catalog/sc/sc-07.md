# SC-7 Boundary Protection {#sc-07}

a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and at key internal managed interfaces within the system;

b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are [Selection: physically; logically] separated from internal organizational networks; and

c. Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and privacy architecture.

## SC-7(1) Physically Separated Subnetworks {#sc-07.01}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SC-7](../sc/sc-07#sc-07).]

## SC-7(2) Public Access {#sc-07.02}

(b) Establish a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;

(c) Protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;

(d) Document each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission or business need and duration of that need;

(e) Review exceptions to the traffic flow policy [Assignment: frequency] and remove exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission or business need;

(f) Prevent unauthorized exchange of control plane traffic with external networks;

(g) Publish information to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized control plane traffic from internal networks; and

(h) Filter unauthorized control plane traffic from external networks.

## SC-7(5) Deny by Default â€” Allow by Exception {#sc-07.05}

Deny network communications traffic by default and allow network communications traffic by exception [Selection (one or more): at managed interfaces; for [Assignment: systems]
                  ].

## SC-7(6) Response to Recognized Failures {#sc-07.06}

## SC-7(14) Protect Against Unauthorized Physical Connections {#sc-07.14}

Protect against unauthorized physical connections at [Assignment: managed interfaces].

## SC-7(15) Networked Privileged Accesses {#sc-07.15}
