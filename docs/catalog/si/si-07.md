# SI-7 Software, Firmware, and Information Integrity {#si-07}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Implementation Level_: system_Contributes to Assurance_: true### Control

a. Employ integrity verification tools to detect unauthorized changes to the following software, firmware, and information: [Assignment: organization-defined software, firmware, and information] ; and

b. Take the following actions when unauthorized changes to the software, firmware, and information are detected: [Assignment: organization-defined actions].

## SI-7(1) Integrity Checks {#si-07.01}

### Control

Perform an integrity check of [Assignment: organization-defined software, firmware, and information]
                  [Selection (one or more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or security-relevant events]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
                  ].

## SI-7(2) Automated Notifications of Integrity Violations {#si-07.02}

### Control

Employ automated tools that provide notification to [Assignment: personnel or roles] upon discovering discrepancies during integrity verification.

## SI-7(3) Centrally Managed Integrity Tools {#si-07.03}

### Control

Employ centrally managed integrity verification tools.

## SI-7(4) Tamper-evident Packaging {#si-07.04}

## SI-7(5) Automated Response to Integrity Violations {#si-07.05}

### Control

Automatically [Selection (one or more): shut down the system; restart the system; implement [Assignment: controls]
                  ] when integrity violations are discovered.

## SI-7(6) Cryptographic Protection {#si-07.06}

### Control

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to detect unauthorized changes to software, firmware, and information.

## SI-7(7) Integration of Detection and Response {#si-07.07}

### Control

Incorporate the detection of the following unauthorized changes into the organizational incident response capability: [Assignment: changes].

## SI-7(8) Auditing Capability for Significant Events {#si-07.08}

### Control

Upon detection of a potential integrity violation, provide the capability to audit the event and initiate the following actions: [Selection (one or more): generate an audit record; alert current user; alert [Assignment: personnel or roles]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: other actions]
                  ].

## SI-7(9) Verify Boot Process {#si-07.09}

### Control

Verify the integrity of the boot process of the following system components: [Assignment: system components].

## SI-7(10) Protection of Boot Firmware {#si-07.10}

### Control

Implement the following mechanisms to protect the integrity of boot firmware in [Assignment: system components]: [Assignment: mechanisms].

## SI-7(11) Confined Environments with Limited Privileges {#si-07.11}

## SI-7(12) Integrity Verification {#si-07.12}

### Control

Require that the integrity of the following user-installed software be verified prior to execution: [Assignment: user-installed software].

## SI-7(13) Code Execution in Protected Environments {#si-07.13}

## SI-7(14) Binary or Machine Executable Code {#si-07.14}

## SI-7(15) Code Authentication {#si-07.15}

## SI-7(16) Time Limit on Process Execution Without Supervision {#si-07.16}

### Control

Prohibit processes from executing without supervision for more than [Assignment: time period].

## SI-7(17) Runtime Application Self-protection {#si-07.17}

### Control

Implement [Assignment: controls] for application self-protection at runtime.
