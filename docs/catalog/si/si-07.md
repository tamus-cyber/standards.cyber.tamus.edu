                  [Selection (one or more): at startup; at [Assignment: organization-defined transitional states or security-relevant events]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]
                  ].

## SI-7(2) Automated Notifications of Integrity Violations {#si-07.02}

Employ centrally managed integrity verification tools.

## SI-7(4) Tamper-evident Packaging {#si-07.04}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SR-9](../sr/sr-09#sr-09).]

## SI-7(5) Automated Response to Integrity Violations {#si-07.05}

Automatically [Selection (one or more): shut down the system; restart the system; implement [Assignment: controls]
                  ] when integrity violations are discovered.

Incorporate the detection of the following unauthorized changes into the organizational incident response capability: [Assignment: changes].

## SI-7(8) Auditing Capability for Significant Events {#si-07.08}

Upon detection of a potential integrity violation, provide the capability to audit the event and initiate the following actions: [Selection (one or more): generate an audit record; alert current user; alert [Assignment: personnel or roles]
                  ; 
                     [Assignment: other actions]
                  ].
