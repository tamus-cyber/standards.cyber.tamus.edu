# SI-13 Predictable Failure Prevention {#si-13}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Contributes to Assurance_: true### Control

a. Determine mean time to failure (MTTF) for the following system components in specific environments of operation: [Assignment: system components] ; and

b. Provide substitute system components and a means to exchange active and standby components in accordance with the following criteria: [Assignment: mean time to failure (MTTF) substitution criteria].

## SI-13(1) Transferring Component Responsibilities {#si-13.01}

### Control

Take system components out of service by transferring component responsibilities to substitute components no later than [Assignment: fraction or percentage] of mean time to failure.

## SI-13(2) Time Limit on Process Execution Without Supervision {#si-13.02}

## SI-13(3) Manual Transfer Between Components {#si-13.03}

### Control

Manually initiate transfers between active and standby system components when the use of the active component reaches [Assignment: percentage] of the mean time to failure.

## SI-13(4) Standby Component Installation and Notification {#si-13.04}

### Control

(a) Ensure that the standby components are successfully and transparently installed within [Assignment: time period] ; and

(b) 
                     [Selection (one or more): activate [Assignment: alarm]
                  ; automatically shut down the system; 
                     [Assignment: action]
                  ].

## SI-13(5) Failover Capability {#si-13.05}

### Control

Provide [Selection: real-time; near real-time]
                  [Assignment: failover capability] for the system.
