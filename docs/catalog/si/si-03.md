# SI-3 Malicious Code Protection {#si-03}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Implementation Level_: system_Texas DIR Baseline_: LOW_Texas DIR Required By_: 2023-07-20### Control

a. Implement [Selection (one or more): signature-based; non-signature-based] malicious code protection mechanisms at system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code;

b. Automatically update malicious code protection mechanisms as new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures;

c. Configure malicious code protection mechanisms to:

1. Perform periodic scans of the system [Assignment: frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection (one or more): endpoint; network entry and exit points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational policy; and

2. 
                     [Selection (one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; take [Assignment: action]
               ] ; and send alert to [Assignment: personnel or roles] in response to malicious code detection; and

d. Address the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the system.
