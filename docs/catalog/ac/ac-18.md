# AC-18 Wireless Access {#ac-18}

a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and

b. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

## AC-18(1) Authentication and Encryption {#ac-18.01}

Protect wireless access to the system using authentication of [Selection (one or more): users; devices] and encryption.

## AC-18(2) Monitoring Unauthorized Connections {#ac-18.02}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [SI-4](../si/si-04#si-04).]

## AC-18(3) Disable Wireless Networking {#ac-18.03}

Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within system components prior to issuance and deployment.

## AC-18(4) Restrict Configurations by Users {#ac-18.04}

Identify and explicitly authorize users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.

## AC-18(5) Antennas and Transmission Power Levels {#ac-18.05}
