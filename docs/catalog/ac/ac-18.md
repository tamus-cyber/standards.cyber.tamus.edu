# AC-18 Wireless Access {#ac-18}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Texas DIR Baseline_: LOW_Texas DIR Required By_: 2023-07-20### Control

a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of wireless access; and

b. Authorize each type of wireless access to the system prior to allowing such connections.

## AC-18(1) Authentication and Encryption {#ac-18.01}

### Control

Protect wireless access to the system using authentication of [Selection (one or more): users; devices] and encryption.

## AC-18(2) Monitoring Unauthorized Connections {#ac-18.02}

## AC-18(3) Disable Wireless Networking {#ac-18.03}

### Control

Disable, when not intended for use, wireless networking capabilities embedded within system components prior to issuance and deployment.

## AC-18(4) Restrict Configurations by Users {#ac-18.04}

### Control

Identify and explicitly authorize users allowed to independently configure wireless networking capabilities.

## AC-18(5) Antennas and Transmission Power Levels {#ac-18.05}

### Control

Select radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to reduce the probability that signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.
