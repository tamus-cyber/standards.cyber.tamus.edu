# Security Control Standards Catalog

Security and privacy control standards described in this control standards catalog have a well-defined
organization and structure. For ease of use in the security and privacy control selection and specification process,
controls are organized into families (listed in the navigation menu to the left). Each family contains controls that
are related to the specific topic of the family. A two-character identifier uniquely identifies each control family
(e.g., PS for Personnel Security). Security and privacy controls may involve aspects of policy, oversight, supervision,
manual processes, and automated mechanisms that are implemented by systems or actions by individuals.
