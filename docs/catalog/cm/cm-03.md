# CM-3 Configuration Change Control {#cm-03}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Contributes to Assurance_: true_Texas DIR Baseline_: MODERATE_Texas DIR Required By_: 2024-11-18_Texas A&M System Required By_: 2022-08-01### Control

a. Determine and document the types of changes to the system that are configuration-controlled;

b. Review proposed configuration-controlled changes to the system and approve or disapprove such changes with explicit consideration for security and privacy impact analyses;

c. Document configuration change decisions associated with the system;

d. Implement approved configuration-controlled changes to the system;

e. Retain records of configuration-controlled changes to the system for [Assignment: time period];

f. Monitor and review activities associated with configuration-controlled changes to the system; and

g. Coordinate and provide oversight for configuration change control activities through [Assignment: configuration change control element] that convenes [Selection (one or more): 
                  [Assignment: frequency]
               ; when [Assignment: configuration change conditions]
               ].

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

All security-related information resources changes shall be approved by the information owner (or designee) through a change control process.

## CM-3(1) Automated Documentation, Notification, and Prohibition of Changes {#cm-03.01}

### Control

(a) Document proposed changes to the system;

(b) Notify [Assignment: approval authorities] of proposed changes to the system and request change approval;

(c) Highlight proposed changes to the system that have not been approved or disapproved within [Assignment: time period];

(d) Prohibit changes to the system until designated approvals are received;

(e) Document all changes to the system; and

(f) Notify [Assignment: personnel] when approved changes to the system are completed.

## CM-3(2) Testing, Validation, and Documentation of Changes {#cm-03.02}

### Control

Test, validate, and document changes to the system before finalizing the implementation of the changes.

## CM-3(3) Automated Change Implementation {#cm-03.03}

### Control

Implement changes to the current system baseline and deploy the updated baseline across the installed base using [Assignment: automated mechanisms].

## CM-3(4) Security and Privacy Representatives {#cm-03.04}

### Control

Require [Assignment: organization-defined security and privacy representatives] to be members of the [Assignment: configuration change control element].

## CM-3(5) Automated Security Response {#cm-03.05}

### Control

## CM-3(6) Cryptography Management {#cm-03.06}

### Control

Ensure that cryptographic mechanisms used to provide the following controls are under configuration management: [Assignment: controls].

## CM-3(7) Review System Changes {#cm-03.07}

### Control

Review changes to the system [Assignment: frequency] or when [Assignment: circumstances] to determine whether unauthorized changes have occurred.
