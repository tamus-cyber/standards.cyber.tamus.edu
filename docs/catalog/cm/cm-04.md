# CM-4 Impact Analyses {#cm-04}

Analyze changes to the system to determine potential security and privacy impacts prior to change implementation.

## CM-4(1) Separate Test Environments {#cm-04.01}

Analyze changes to the system in a separate test environment before implementation in an operational environment, looking for security and privacy impacts due to flaws, weaknesses, incompatibility, or intentional malice.

## CM-4(2) Verification of Controls {#cm-04.02}

After system changes, verify that the impacted controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with regard to meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system.
