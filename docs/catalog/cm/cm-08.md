1. Accurately reflects the system;

2. Includes all components within the system;

3. Does not include duplicate accounting of components or components assigned to any other system;

4. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and

5. Includes the following information to achieve system component accountability: [Assignment: information] ; and

b. Review and update the system component inventory [Assignment: frequency].

## CM-8(1) Updates During Installation and Removal {#cm-08.01}

### Control

Update the inventory of system components as part of component installations, removals, and system updates.

## CM-8(2) Automated Maintenance {#cm-08.02}
