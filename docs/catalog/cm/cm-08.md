# CM-8 System Component Inventory {#cm-08}

a. Develop and document an inventory of system components that:

1. Accurately reflects the system;

2. Includes all components within the system;

3. Does not include duplicate accounting of components or components assigned to any other system;

4. Is at the level of granularity deemed necessary for tracking and reporting; and

5. Includes the following information to achieve system component accountability: [Assignment: information] ; and

b. Review and update the system component inventory [Assignment: frequency].

## CM-8(1) Updates During Installation and Removal {#cm-08.01}

Update the inventory of system components as part of component installations, removals, and system updates.

## CM-8(2) Automated Maintenance {#cm-08.02}

Maintain the currency, completeness, accuracy, and availability of the inventory of system components using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms].

## CM-8(3) Automated Unauthorized Component Detection {#cm-08.03}

(a) Detect the presence of unauthorized hardware, software, and firmware components within the system using [Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms]
                     [Assignment: frequency] ; and

(b) Take the following actions when unauthorized components are detected: [Selection (one or more): disable network access by unauthorized components; isolate unauthorized components; notify [Assignment: personnel or roles]

## CM-8(4) Accountability Information {#cm-08.04}

Include in the system component inventory information, a means for identifying by [Selection (one or more): name; position; role] , individuals responsible and accountable for administering those components.

## CM-8(5) No Duplicate Accounting of Components {#cm-08.05}

[Withdrawn: Incorporated into [CM-8](../cm/cm-08#cm-08).]

## CM-8(6) Assessed Configurations and Approved Deviations {#cm-08.06}

Include assessed component configurations and any approved deviations to current deployed configurations in the system component inventory.

## CM-8(7) Centralized Repository {#cm-08.07}

Provide a centralized repository for the inventory of system components.

## CM-8(8) Automated Location Tracking {#cm-08.08}

Support the tracking of system components by geographic location using [Assignment: automated mechanisms].

## CM-8(9) Assignment of Components to Systems {#cm-08.09}

(a) Assign system components to a system; and

(b) Receive an acknowledgement from [Assignment: personnel or roles] of this assignment.
