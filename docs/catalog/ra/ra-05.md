# RA-5 Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning {#ra-05}

_Implementation Level_: organization_Contributes to Assurance_: true_Texas DIR Baseline_: LOW_Texas DIR Required By_: 2023-07-20### Control

a. Monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in the system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported;

b. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:

1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;

2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and

3. Measuring vulnerability impact;

c. Analyze vulnerability scan reports and results from vulnerability monitoring;

d. Remediate legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk;

e. Share information obtained from the vulnerability monitoring process and control assessments with [Assignment: personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other systems; and

f. Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.

### Texas DIR Implementation Statement

The state organization scans for vulnerabilities in the information system at least annually or when significant new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are identified and reported.

## RA-5(1) Update Tool Capability {#ra-05.01}

## RA-5(2) Update Vulnerabilities to Be Scanned {#ra-05.02}

### Control

Update the system vulnerabilities to be scanned [Selection (one or more): 
                     [Assignment: frequency]
                  ; prior to a new scan; when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported].

## RA-5(3) Breadth and Depth of Coverage {#ra-05.03}

### Control

Define the breadth and depth of vulnerability scanning coverage.

## RA-5(4) Discoverable Information {#ra-05.04}

### Control

Determine information about the system that is discoverable and take [Assignment: corrective actions].

## RA-5(5) Privileged Access {#ra-05.05}

### Control

Implement privileged access authorization to [Assignment: system components] for [Assignment: vulnerability scanning activities].

## RA-5(6) Automated Trend Analyses {#ra-05.06}

### Control

Compare the results of multiple vulnerability scans using [Assignment: automated mechanisms].

## RA-5(7) Automated Detection and Notification of Unauthorized Components {#ra-05.07}

## RA-5(8) Review Historic Audit Logs {#ra-05.08}

### Control

Review historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in a [Assignment: system] has been previously exploited within an [Assignment: time period].

## RA-5(9) Penetration Testing and Analyses {#ra-05.09}

## RA-5(10) Correlate Scanning Information {#ra-05.10}

### Control

Correlate the output from vulnerability scanning tools to determine the presence of multi-vulnerability and multi-hop attack vectors.

## RA-5(11) Public Disclosure Program {#ra-05.11}

### Control

Establish a public reporting channel for receiving reports of vulnerabilities in organizational systems and system components.
